# Welcome to LightningCV
> LightningCV is a thin wrapper over <a href='https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning'>PyTorch Lightning</a> for tackling computer vision tasks with SOTA techniques.


This library is a collection of models, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders / augmentations that aim to pull together a wide variety of SOTA models. In this library we aim to gather SOTA work already done and put then together is one place.

We use ideas from `fastai`, `timm` and integrate them in the `pytorch-lightning` ecosystem.

`LightningCV` is just plain `pytorch` wrapped with `pytorch-lightning`. Any thing that can be done in `pytorch`/ `pytorch-lightning` can be achieved in `LightningCV`.

## What is this project?

This project was started by me (Ayushman Buragohain) as way to collect interesting techniques that were documented in `Kaggle`, deeplearning forums, ideas released during `Kaggle Competions` and the fantastic work of others (mostly from fastai and timm) into one centralized place.

All credits go the original authors and I have tried to reference the code wherever possible.
